<h1 align='center'> Advanced Mobile Application Programming for the Android Platform </h1>

This project involved creating an Android app using **Jetpack Compose**, **Kotlin**, and a **local database**.  

The app allows users to:  
- Create a simple profile with a name and profile picture.  
- Choose a difficulty level for a color-based game.  
- Play the game with a limited number of attempts.  

The app also includes a **local leaderboard** and consists of 4–5 screens in total, demonstrating UI design, local data storage, and basic game mechanics.
